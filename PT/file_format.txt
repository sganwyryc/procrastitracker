The information below should be sufficient for a programmer to read the database files, if required

The whole file is written thru zlib, so can be read with that, or first unpacked with gzip

struct DATABASE {
	int version (== 10, as of v1.6, format may be different if other version)
	int magic (== 'PTFF' on x86)
	int numtags
	struct { char name[32]; int color; } tags[numtags]
	int minfilter
	int foldlevel
	int prefs[6] (see advanced prefs window)
	NODE root
}

struct NODE {
	char *name (null terminated bytes)
	int tagindex
	char ishidden
	int numberofdays
	DAY days[numberofdays]
	int numchildren
	NODE children[numchildren]
}

struct DAY {
	unsigned short day (lower 5 bits = day, next 4 bits = month, rest = year counted from 2000)
	unsigned short firstminuteused (counted from midnight)
	int activeseconds, semiidleseconds, key, lmb, rmb, scrollwheel
}
